Repo for experimenting with React, Typescript and Vite. Components, props and other react functions are implemented.
# React Experimenting
**Overview**

This repo started off as a static way for me to mess around with the different parts of React. It then evolved into messing around with dark mode and colours and various other parts of MERN.

In the app there is multiple images which load relevant components that explore the different parts of React found from this roadmap: https://roadmap.sh/react
